            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                My legal name may be 8 words long, but the name I go by is Usman. I am ethnically Pakistani but hold
                multiple citizenships and residencies. I am a senior, but feel like I’ve been here 7 years. I do not like 
                computer science or programming; my original choiceof major was Business Management, but since Business is 
                in its essence, Problem Solving, what better major to take than Computer Science which is built on problem solving.
                Plus, Business Management is a stupid course (take the offence SBA students).

            <h2>Fun Fact</h2>
            <p>
                I can get you Residence Permits and Citizenships/Passports from Free, all the way to $1.5 million :)
                All legal of course. Some people don’t like to use their primary Identification in certain situations, 
                like the Republic of Palau ID card attached above which doesn’t mention my nationality and protects my 
                deeper identity in case of discrimination at banks, hotels, etc.
